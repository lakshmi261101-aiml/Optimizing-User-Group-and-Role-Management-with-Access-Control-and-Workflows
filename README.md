# Optimizing-User-Group-and-Role-Management-with-Access-Control-and-Workflows
This project focuses on streamlining and automating the management of users, groups, and roles in ServiceNow through robust access control policies and customized workflows. It aims to enhance security, reduce manual efforts, and ensure compliance by implementing role-based access control (RBAC), automated provisioning/de-provisioning processes, and approval workflows. The solution improves operational efficiency, ensures accurate access rights, and supports scalable IT service management across the organization.
